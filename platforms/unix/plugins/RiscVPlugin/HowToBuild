Building the RiscVPlugin
------------------------------

In the build dirctory for the platform (e.g. building/linux64x64 for 64-bit linux)
locate the riscv directory.  In that directory use the makeem script, which
invokes conf.COG, to configure and build the gdb-derived simulator for Risc-V.  Then build a VM that has RiscVPlugin in its plugins.ext.
